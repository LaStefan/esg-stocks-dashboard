### Understanding the Sharpe Ratio:
The **Sharpe Ratio** measures the risk-adjusted return of an investment, helping you understand if the returns are worth the risks taken. It is calculated as the difference between an investment's returns and the risk-free rate, divided by the standard deviation of returns.

- **A Sharpe Ratio greater than 1** is generally considered good, indicating that the investmentâ€™s returns are well compensated for the risk.
- **A ratio above 2** is seen as very good, while **above 3** is considered excellent.
- **A ratio below 1** suggests that the returns may not justify the risk, and a **negative ratio** means the returns are lower than the risk-free rate.

### What is the Risk-Free Rate?
The **risk-free rate** represents the return on a risk-free investment, typically government bonds like U.S. Treasury bonds. It is used as a benchmark to measure other investments. In this chart, you can adjust the risk-free rate using the slider, allowing you to see how changes affect the Sharpe Ratios of different companies. A higher risk-free rate makes it harder for investments to show a high Sharpe Ratio, as they need to outperform a higher baseline.
