This chart shows the relationship between ESG scores and Sharpe Ratios for companies, highlighting whether higher ESG scores are associated with better risk-adjusted returns.
         
The **Sharpe Ratio** displayed here is calculated based on daily returns, which are then annualized to provide a theoretical estimate of the annual risk-adjusted return. This approach assumes 252 trading days in a year. 
So, while the underlying data might cover multiple years or different time spans depending on the stock, the resulting Sharpe Ratio is meant to give an **annual perspective** on risk-adjusted returns.

### Understanding Sharpe Ratio:
The **Sharpe Ratio** measures the risk-adjusted return of an investment, helping you understand if the returns are worth the risks taken. It is calculated as the difference between an investment's returns and the risk-free rate, divided by the standard deviation of returns.

- **A Sharpe Ratio greater than 1** is generally considered good, indicating that the investmentâ€™s returns are well compensated for the risk.
- **A ratio above 2** is seen as very good, while **above 3** is considered excellent.
- **A ratio below 1** suggests that the returns may not justify the risk, and a **negative ratio** means the returns are lower than the risk-free rate.

### What is the Risk-Free Rate?
The **risk-free rate** represents the return on a risk-free investment, typically government bonds like U.S. Treasury bonds. Here, we use a fixed risk-free rate of 2%, serving as a benchmark to assess other investments.
